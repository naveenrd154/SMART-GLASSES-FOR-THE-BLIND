# SMART GLASSES FOR THE BLIND

## Overview
Smart Glasses for the Blind is an assistive wearable device designed to help visually impaired users detect nearby obstacles and navigate safely. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement and provides audio alerts through a buzzer, enabling safer and more confident mobility.

## Description
Developed smart wearable glasses using an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection. An NE555 timer is used to trigger a buzzer alert when an obstacle is detected within a predefined range. The system is powered by a 3.7V battery, making it portable, low-power, and suitable for daily use. The design focuses on improving mobility, safety, and independence for visually impaired users.

## Key Features
- Real-time obstacle detection
- Audio alert using buzzer
- Portable and lightweight wearable design
- Battery-powered low-power operation
